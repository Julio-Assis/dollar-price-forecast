# dollar-price-forecast
The focus of this repository is to implement different machine learning algorithms that have access to the timeseries data of different derivatives and try to predict the price of the dollar in D+1. Also, we want to evaluate these different models against each other by using relevant validation metrics on the timeseries forecast problem.
